# Phase 3 Week 1(Toy Problems)

## Prerequisite

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.

2. Use Python to wire down the solution.

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading

5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.

## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

Converting a `12-hour` time like `"8:30 am"` or `"8:30 pm"` to `24-hour` time (like `"0830"` or `"2030"`) sounds easy enough, right? Well, let's see if you can do it!

You will have to define a function, which will be given an hour (always in the range of `1 to 12`, inclusive), a minute (always in the range of `0 to 59`, inclusive), and a period (either `"am" or "pm"`) as input.

Your task is to return a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.

### Notes

By convention, noon is 12:00 pm, and midnight is 12:00 am.

On 12-hours clock, there is no 0 hour, and time just after midnight is denoted as, for example, 12:15 am. On 24-hour clock, this translates to 0015.

## Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive.

Task:
Your job is to write a function, which takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as arguments, and returns `True `if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and `False` - otherwise.

Examples:
(2, 4, -3) == True

(-4, 6, 8) == True

(4, -6, 9) == True

(-4, 6, 0) == False

(4, 6, 10) == False

(-14, -3, -4) == False

## Challenge 3: Consonant value

Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".We shall assign the following values: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26`.

Examples;
For the word `"zodiacs"`, solve(`"zodiacs"`) = `26`
For example, for the word `"zodiacs"`, let's cross out the vowels. We get: `"z d cs"`

-- The consonant substrings are: `"z"`, `"d"` and `"cs"` and the values are `z = 26`, `d = 4` and `cs = 3 + 19 = 22`. The highest is `26`.

For the word `"strength"`, solve(`"strength"`) = `57`.

The consonant substrings are: `"str" `and `"ngth"` with values `"str" = 19 + 20 + 18 = 57` and `"ngth" = 14 + 7 + 20 + 8 = 49`. The highest is `57`.

## Technologies Used

The following have been used on this project:

- [Python3](https://docs.python.org/3.10/)
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html)

## Project Setup

- Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
- Navigate to cloned repository: `cd phase-3-wk1-code-challenge`
- Create pipenv environment: `pipenv shell`
- Install dependencies: ` pipenv install`
- Run test using pytest: `pytest`
